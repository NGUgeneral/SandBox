1. Implement HeapSort;
2. Implement ShellSort;
3. Cover existing sorting algorithms with tests;
4. Implement algorithm for finding the biggest common divider for a set of numbers;
5. Implement cumulative Fibonacci sequence method: build FibSequence, which first time build a given sequence and writes results to an external file. When called next time - deserialez existing sequence, tries find the result there and if can't - extends the library and updates the external file;
