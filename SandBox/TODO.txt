1. Rewrite sorting implementations to be tasks instead of sync methods;
2. Implement ShellSort;
3. Cover existing sorting algorithms with tests (use NUnit);
4. Implement algorithm for finding the biggest common divider for a set of numbers and lowest common miltiple;
5. Implement cumulative Fibonacci sequence method: build FibSequence, which first time build a given sequence and writes results to an external file. When called next time - deserialez existing sequence, tries find the result there and if can't - extends the library and updates the external file;
