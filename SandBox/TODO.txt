0.	Learn to traverse multidimensional and nested arrays;

1.1.	Optimize Tictactoe algorithm to hadle 3 in a row instead of whole line, for fields side > 3;
1.2.	Evolve Tictactoe into a Match3;

2.1.	Implement ShellSort;
2.2.	Reimplement the heap sort, using the tree data structure;

3.1.	Write all trees independent, in the process determine similar functionality and based on it - made a unified interfface;
3.2.	OrderedBinaryTree structure inserting well just a single node, but does not if inserting a sub tree;
3.3.	Introduce a unified interface for tree (so after - tree, unsorted binary tree, sorted binary tree and red/black tree can be introduced);
